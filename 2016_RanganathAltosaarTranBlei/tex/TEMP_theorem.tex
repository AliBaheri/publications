\begin{theorem}
  Consider a posterior distribution $p(\mbz\g\mbx)$ with a finite number of latent
  variables and continuous quantile function.
  Assume the operator variational objective has a unique root achieved
  by the posterior $p(\mbz\g\mbx)$.
  Then there exists a sequence of parameters
  $\lambda_1,\lambda_2\ldots,$ in the variational program
  $q(\mbz\g\lambda)$ such that it converges in distribution to
  $p(\mbz\g\mbx)$.
\end{theorem}
