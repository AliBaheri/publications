We have introduced the generalized reparameterization gradient (\acrshort{G-REP}), a technique to extend the standard reparameterization gradient to a wider class of variational distributions. As the standard reparameterization method, our method is applicable to any probabilistic model that is differentiable with respect to the latent variables. We have demonstrated the generalized reparameterization gradient on two nonconjugate probabilistic models to fit a variational approximation involving gamma and beta distributions. We have also empirically shown that a single Monte Carlo sample is enough to obtain a noisy estimate of the gradient, therefore leading to a fast inference procedure.
