A generalization of the GEE procedure, which yields parameter estimates and fitted values that are resistant to influential data, is introduced. Resistant generalized estimating equations (REGEE) include weights in the estimating equations to downweight influential observations or clusters. Influential observations are downweighted according to their leverage or residual in an example of correlated binary regression applied to 137 urinary incontinent elderly patients from 38 medical practices.},

     abstract = {We investigate robustness in the logistic regression model.
       Copas has studied two forms of robust estimator: a robust-resistant
         estimate of Pregibon and an estimate based on a misclassification
         model. He concluded that robust-resistant estimates are much more
         biased in small samples than the usual logistic estimate is and
         recommends a bias-corrected version of the misclassification estimate.
         We show that there are other versions of robust-resistant estimates
         which have bias often approximately the same as and sometimes even less
         than the logistic estimate; these estimates belong to the Mallows
         class. In addition, the corrected misclassification estimate is
         inconsistent at the logistic model; we develop a simple consistent
         modification. The modified estimate is a member of the Mallows class
         but, unlike most robust estimates, it has an interpretable tuning
         constant. The results are illustrated on data sets featuring different
         kinds of outliers.},

We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}
