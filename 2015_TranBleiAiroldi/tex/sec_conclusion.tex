% what we did


We developed \glsreset{CVI}\gls{CVI}.  \gls{CVI} is a new variational
inference algorithm that augments the mean-field variational
distribution with a copula; it captures posterior dependencies among
the latent variables.  We derived a scalable and generic algorithm for
performing inference with this expressive variational distribution.
We found that \gls{CVI} significantly reduces the bias of the
mean-field approximation, better estimates the posterior variance, and
is more accurate than other forms of capturing posterior dependency in
variational approximations.
