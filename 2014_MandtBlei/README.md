* plot scripts * 

- open the plot scripts in /fig/src with "ipython notebook --pylab" (a browser window will pop up).



* data files *

- meaning of the columns of the data files that begin with "ARX_BIAS_VAR_...":
  0: iterations, 1: run time in hours, 2: held-out likelihood, 3: to be ignored, 4: squared bias, 5: variance, 6: squared error.

- columns in all other data files (without "BIAS_VAR"):
  0: iterations, 1: run time in hours, 2: held-out likelihood, 3: to be ignored.
