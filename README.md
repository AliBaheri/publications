Publications
============

A folder containing the pdf and LaTeX source each paper (and sometimes the code and data used to generate the figures).

## Conventions

* Folders for each paper are labeled "YYYY_LastNames". For example, "2014_GopalanCharlinBlei".

* In each folder, the pdf (and possibly .bib entry) are in the root. 

* This is the subdirectory convention:
 * /fig
  * /fig/src
  * /fig/dat
  * /fig/pdf
 * /tex
 * /tex/sty
